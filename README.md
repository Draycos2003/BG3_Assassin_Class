# BG3_Assassin_Class
My personal rendition of a stand-alone Assassin class for BG3.
I always hated that Assassin was simply a subclass of Rogue, and not it's own class, so I turned it into one.

This class goes a full 20 levels with a single subclass at level 3 called Master Assassin.

Fell free to leave a comment and let me know what you think.
